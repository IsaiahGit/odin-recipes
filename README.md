Hi, this is a HTML project that features a website containing three of my favorite recipes. 

In the process I used my knowledge of html elements, tags, and attributes to create my webpages. I also got more comfortable using Git and Github, and updating my repo. All in all, a solid learning experience, and I feel as if I have a decent grasp on HTML and how to use it, at least for simple projects such as this.
