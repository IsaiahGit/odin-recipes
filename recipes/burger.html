    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe brings me back to freshman year, where the "kitchen" I had
        access to was very limited, and a floor below my dorm room. Trying to save
        money, I would cook from time to time, and this was a staple dish. Smashed Cheeseburgers.
        You can prepare them lightning quick, their delicious, and minimal dishes to clean.
