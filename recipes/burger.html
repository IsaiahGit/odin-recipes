    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe brings me back to freshman year, where the "kitchen" I had
        access to was very limited, and a floor below my dorm room. Trying to save
        money, I would cook from time to time, and this was a staple dish. Smashed Cheeseburgers.
        You can prepare them lightning quick, their delicious, and minimal dishes to clean.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces of ground beef, divided into 2 2oz balls</li>
        <li>A slice of American cheese</li>
        <li>A hamburger bun</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Desired condiments and toppings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start preheating the pan on high heat. While the pan is heating up drop in the butter
            and toast the inner part of the buns, until golden brown. Remove and set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Place both ground beef balls in the pan, and use a spatula to smash them into patties,
             as thin as possible. Season the beef generously with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Cook until both patties develop a nice brown crust and the top begins turning a pale pink.
            Scrape up the pattie to get all the brown bits and flip them over.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Place the cheese on one of the patties and cook until melted. Then remove from the pan
             and add to the buns. Add on desired toppings and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
