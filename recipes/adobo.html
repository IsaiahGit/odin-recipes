    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken adobo is a dish that comes from the Philippines. Known for its signature tanginess,
        adobo is best served with rice, or potatoes. My mom first found out about this recipe through
         my aunt, who is a Filipino immigrant. And though it might not be true to the original, her 
         adobo still hits the spot. This iteration uses a few ingredients to pack maximum flavor.
