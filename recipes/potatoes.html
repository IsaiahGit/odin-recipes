    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>I have always had a fascination in cooking potatoes. Whether it be mashed, roasted, fried, boiled, or
        anything in between, I've probably cooked potatoes that way. However, not every method of cooking is 
        created equally. Some offer more flavor, some convenience, some have neither. Air frying, though, seems
        to balance the best of every world with potatoes, and is a low fuss way of cooking them.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Potatoes, any variety</li>
        <li>Avocado oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Clean potatoes by scrubbing them with a brush and running under water. Then cut potoes into
            1 inch chuncks, aiming for an even thickness.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add potatoes to bowl and add enough oil to coat each potato piece in a thin layer. Make sure 
            each piece is coated then add salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Note: Do not over season here, 
            because you can add seasonings after they are cooked too.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Put the potatoes in the air fryer and cook at 350 for 30 minutes, or until golden brown, shaking
            the fryer basket every 10 minutes. Remove from air fryer and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
