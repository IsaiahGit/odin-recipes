    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>I have always had a fascination in cooking potatoes. Whether it be mashed, roasted, fried, boiled, or
        anything in between, I've probably cooked potatoes that way. However, not every method of cooking is 
        created equally. Some offer more flavor, some convenience, some have neither. Air frying, though, seems
        to balance the best of every world with potatoes, and is a low fuss way of cooking them.
